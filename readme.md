# Implement your custom console chat with AI assistant

## Pre Steps:
1. ðŸ”‘ Add to the project Open-AI API key https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys (It is not Free, you
   need to pay 1-10$ for subscription)
2. Use this URL to connect to OpenAI API https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions

## You need to create CONSOLE application that will:
1. Apply user message from console
2. Send user message with all conversation history to OpenAI API
3. Stream response from AI to console
4. Finish application via command `exit` in console

## Steps:
PAY ATTENTION PROJECT WON'T COMPILE UNTIL YOU IMPLEMENT `Role` ENUM AND PASS THE `RoleTest`
1. Create enum with roles (`enum Role`) with roles `system`, `user`, `assistant`
2. Create DTO for message, that will consist of `role` and `content`
3. Create DTO for conversation, that will have of `id` and `messages` list
4. Create `task.OpenAIClient` that applies history, go to Open AI API, stream response to console and return
   AI `message`
5. Create `task.ChatApp` with `main` method that will work with console
6. **Don't forget to add Open AI `API_KEY` in `Constant` class**

  I'm getting an error while running my Python script.
  ```
  ~ ... Whatâ€™s the error message?
    ```
  'ModuleNotFoundError: No module named requests'.

## Main Criteria for Application Functionality:
1. Streaming in Console:
    > Ensure that the application streams output continuously in the console, reflecting real-time interactions or updates.

2. Conversation History Support:
    > The application should support a history of conversations, allowing LLM to see previous interactions.
